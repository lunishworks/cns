                <p>
                  CNS Studios is a project of Aaron Gerkens. I maintain all of these services running on the `cns-studios.com` domain and all subdomains. If you want to contact me:
                  <br>
                  My full legal name: <span class="highlight">Aaron Gerkens</span>

                <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
                <p>
                    CNS Studios collects the minimal information necessary to provide our services. We use this data to keep our systems secure.
                    We are committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining data security. All information is used to prevent spam, cyberattacks, and to save data for users of our services.
                </p>
                
                <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Username (chosen by you). This is used to verify the identity of the user in association with the PIN. Without these, we can't grant access to the user's data, delete, or modify it. If a user forgets their credentials, we have to verify their identity with other metrics such as login behavior or IP locations.</li>
                    <li>4-digit PIN (encrypted). This is safely stored on our servers and encrypted. We use this PIN to verify the user's identity. It's encrypted and can only be decrypted with the matching JSON Web Token string. This string is stored on our servers, and without it, PINs can't be decrypted. The owner, Aaron Gerkens, can still delete the PIN if the JSON Web Token string is gone.</li>
                    <li>Last login IP address. This is used to prevent spam and detect other unusual activities, so we can detect cyberattacks. This information is stored for seven days and is then deleted.</li>
                    <li>Last login timestamp. This is used to prevent spam and detect other unusual activities, so we can detect and prevent cyberattacks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1.2 Usage Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Project interactions. Without it, users will lose any progress they made on any of our services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1.3 Cookies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Authentication tokens (httpOnly cookies). Without them, users would have to log in every time they load any of our sites. The authentication tokens are stored for seven days in the user's browser cache and then expire, and can't be reused.</li>
                    <li>User preferences, such as Light/Dark mode or Audio on/off. This information is only stored in the user's browser cache.</li>
                </ul>
